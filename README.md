# AngularExampleApp

This project was originally generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.7.
Since then, the Angular version has been updated to 18.2.

## Usage:

This repository was cloned and edited as a part of my DevOps course.

## Assignments

We added a CHANGELOG file and learned about the usage of Tags etc. I didn't end up adding later changes there since only one assignment required us to do so.

I added some unit tests for the "feedback" component that go through the functionality of the form.

We added and configured ESLint on the project.

### Github actions and Azure

We created a workflow to build, test and deploy the app to Azure.
We learned how to create a docker image etc, and to create the web app on Azure.
